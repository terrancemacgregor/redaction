The application is a redaction engine designed to allow users to upload PDF files, 
extract and redact sensitive information such as names, and download the redacted document. 
It provides an interface where users can upload PDFs, view the metadata (like file name, 
page count, etc.), and adjust the character buffer size for text processing. 
The redaction process is triggered by a "Redact" button that sends text buffers to a 
Redaction API, which returns the redacted text and extracted names.

The application continuously processes the PDF content, updating the Inspection Text Area 
with API outputs (original text, found names, and redacted text) while appending redacted 
text to the Redacted TextArea. After the redaction is complete, the user can download a 
text file with the redacted content, named with a timestamp. This process is facilitated 
through an easy-to-use web app, with a focus on streamlining document handling and 
redaction workflows.
